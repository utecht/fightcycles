<em>Instructions:</em>
<break>
You are a Fight Cycle Rider.  Your Fight Cycle will leave a colored trail behind it.
<break>
By intersecting your own trail, you will remove chunks from the board. These chunks
<break>
turn black, showing that there is no board there.  If you run into a missing chunk of
<break>
board, the boundaries of the board, or are caught in a shape your opponent makes, you
<break>
die.  Likewise, your opponent(s) will suffer a similar fate if they do likewise.
<break>
Yellow event markers cover the board.  Some will cause deadly scorpions to crawl on
<break>
the board.  DO NOT GET HIT BY SCORPIONS. Some will cause an Awesome Possum to leave
<break>
additional holes on the board. Some will cause Wallace the Walrus to spit bees at you.
<break>
DO NOT GET HIT BY BEES. Some will cause patches of ice to form, making maneuvers tricky.
<break>
APPROACH ICE WITH CAUTION.  You now know how to play Fight Cycles.
