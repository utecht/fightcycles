<em>Instructions:</em>
<br>
You are a Fightcycler.  Your Fightcycle will leave a colored Fighttrail behind it.
<br>
By intersecting your own Fighttrail, you will remove Fightchunks from the Fightboard. These Fightchunks
<br>
turn black, showing that there is no Fightboard there.  If you run into a missing Fightchunk of
<br>
Fightboard, the boundaries of the Fightboard, or are caught in a Fightshape your opponent makes, you
<br>
die.  Your opponent(s) will suffer a similar Fightfate if they do likewise.
<br>
Green event Fightmarkers cover the Fightboard.  Some will cause deadly Fightscorpions to crawl on
<br>
the Fightboard.  DO NOT GET HIT BY FIGHTSCORPIONS. Some will cause an Awesome Possum to leave
<br>
additional Fightholes on the board. Some will cause Wallace the FightWalrus to spit Fightbees at you.
<br>
DO NOT GET HIT BY FIGHTBEES. Some will cause Fightpatches of Fightice to Fightform, making Fightmaneuvers tricky.
<br>
APPROACH FIGHTICE WITH CAUTION.
<br>
To be a Fightcycler is to know combat without end.  There is no means by which to truly win: you must continue to
<br>
Fightcycle your opponent until one of you Fightconcedes or drops from Fightxhaustion. Such is the Fightlife and Fightdeath
<br>
of a Fightcycling Fightwarrior! CONTINUE TO FIGHTCYCLE UNTIL FIGHTDEFEAT IS FIGHTCONCEDED. Below, your color-coded Fightscore
<br>
is kept, indicating the number of times you have Fightsploded.  Strive to keep your Fightscore low, lest you face humiliation
<br>
at the hands of your Fightpeers. YOUR FIGHTDEATHS ARE RECORDED BELOW. You now know how to play Fightcycles.

<em>Controls</em>
<br>
Below are the controls for multiplayer Fightcycling. The top and bottom keys speed up and slow
<br>
down your Fightcycle, respectively, while the left and right keys turn your Fightcycle in that
<br>
direction. The keys for each player are displayed below, and color coded to the Fightcycle.
<br>
(Except for white, which is color coded as black)
